## HTML-CSS accessibility Debugging and code optimization



**Scope and objectives**


The stated site was to be evaluated in terms of accessibility factor to match the required standard in terms of visual or compatibility with text-to-speech functionality of the webpage
The code required to be cleared of all clutter to provide a smoother user experience
The webpage was missing or contained buggy codes in terms of functionality at certain locations
The index.html file was required to be restructured to match the requirement for a semantic HTML structure



**Work done**


Both HTML and CSS files on hand have been modified via:

*   Clearing clutter/code optimization by removing repetitive codes in styles.css and index.html files
*   HTML reforming to restructure using Header, main, aside, footer, etc. to represent semantic structure
*   Missing accessibility attributes for images have been added in index.html file
*   Title head has been changed for the landing page for better searchability
*   Broken links were identified within the HTML code and have been resolved


**Details**

*   The step-by-step version of the process has been committed to the git repo found below: https://mahdi-moradzadeh.github.io/challenge-subHTMLCSS/

*   The initial commit was identification of issues under the commit labeled "Identifying the issues" where the problems have been diagnosed and pointed out via comments in the original source code
*   The secondary changes and touch up accessibility changes have been implemented under "Initial debugginh implement according to comment made in the past commit" where missing alternative texts, poor visibility have been tackled
*   The third stage was to restructure the entire HTML format to meet the requirement of a semantic HTML where terms such as main, footer, aside, body etc. were replaced
